# Slack + Steampipe

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a messaging program designed specifically for the workplace.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open-source zero-ETL engine to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

For example:

```sql
select
  email,
  is_admin
from
  slack_user;
```

```
+-----------------+----------+
| email|          | is_admin |
+-----------------+----------+
| pam@dmi.com     | false    |
| creed@dmi.com   | true     |
| stanley@dmi.com | false    |
| michael@dmi.com | true     |
| dwight@dmi.com  | false    |
+-----------------+----------+
```

## Get started

### Install

Download and install the latest Slack plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install slack
```

### Credentials

API tokens in Slack are associated with Apps. To use Steampipe, you need to create an App in Slack with the appropriate permissions.

1. Sign in to the Slack website, and view "Your Apps" at https://api.slack.com/apps.
2. Select **Create New App**.
3. Select **From scratch**.
4. Enter an application name, e.g., `Steampipe CLI`, and select your workspace.
5. Select **Add features & functionality**.
6. Select **Permissions**.
7. Scroll down to "Scopes" and then "User Token Scopes".
8. Add permissions by scope, using the table below to grant the required read access.
9. Scroll up to "OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace" and (re)install your app.
10. Copy the user OAuth token for the application. It looks like `xoxp-2556146250-EXAMPLE-1646968370949-df954218b5da5b8614c85cc454136b27`.

### Permissions and Scopes

Scopes are used to determine the permissions and access granted to your App in Slack.
Steampipe requires different permissions for each table. We recommend granting
the `team:read` scope and all of the scopes in the table below, but you can
restrict them to specific tables if you prefer.

Please note that if you add scopes to an application, you will need to reinstall the application to the workspace for the changes to take effect.

### Configuration

Installing the latest slack plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/slack.spc`) with a single connection named `slack`:

```hcl
connection "slack" {
  plugin = "slack"

  # The Slack app token used to connect to the API.
  # Can also be set with the SLACK_TOKEN environment variable.
  #token = "xoxp-YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
}
```
